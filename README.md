# t7-source
 My decompiled scripts from Black Ops 3\
 These are decompiled using a heavily modified version of Cerberus. \
 They include live dumped scripts, and all sorts of fixes and features that were not originally supported.

# Please report bugs.
If you locate places that look weird or broken, please tell me and I will try to fix them. \
Thanks for the hashes https://github.com/Jake-NotTheMuss/t7-hashes/blob/master/hashes.csv
